# Tech Spec
The _Tech Spec_ is an important part of a project, but it's a part that's often overlooked or skipped. The intention of this document is to organize everyone's thoughts on the project into one simple, succinct document. It doesn't have to be super detailed but filling out this document will help keep everyone focused on the project goal.

## Overview
This section should be comprised of 1-3 short paragraphs giving a high-level overview of what the project hopes to accomplish. This overview should quickly define what the project hopes to do, what this document will cover, and what will not be covered. 

## Scenarios
This section (and subsections) should describe a couple of real-world scenarios that demonstrate the need for the project. This should include an example of the problem, and an example of how the project will resolve that problem. It is recommended that at least 2 scenarios are provided.

## Non Goals
Simply put: what are you _not_ doing with the project at this time? This section is vital to keeping everyone on task and avoid gold-plating. This section can be broken down to illustrate what won't be considered now, but what may be considered in future iterations of the project.

## Minimum Viable Product
Now that you've defined what you won't do with this project (at least in the beginning): what are you going to do? What is the minimum functionality required to launch a successful initial product? Define that here!

## Diorama-rama
Can you put your project into pictures? Sure you can! We recommend using [draw.io](https://draw.io) because it's free and you can make pretty diagrams of all sorts like this:

## Components
Break down your project into as many different sections or components as possible. This could include various pages for a web app, or endpoints for an API project just to name a couple of examples. Try to include any wireframes or mock-ups you can to fully illustrate your idea for each piece!

## Roadmap
Give some timelines. These don't have to be fully detailed, but it's good to set goals and make them visible. Any dates here should match _Milestones_ set in the github project.

## Contact Info
Give as much, or as little, info as you want here.
