# ProjectTemplate
The project template for Code for Baltimore github projects.  This project will help your project get started by giving you:
* A standard issues template
* A standard pull request
* A standard docs folder with example documentation.
* A big thumbs up :thumbsup:

## Documentation
We've included a `docs` folder with a template [Tech Spec](/docs/Tech_Spec.md) and [Best Practices](/docs/Best_Practices.md) document, though using Github's Wiki capabilities is also a good idea. This will get you started with documenting your project.  Other documents and relevant information that has no other place can live in the `docs` folder.  Replace this paragraph with a brief breakdown of what you've included in your `docs` folder.

## Setup
What does someone need to do to get started with your project? Do they need to:
* install software?
* run some commands?
* do something else?

In this section of the `README` you should include any information a new contributor or user of the project needs to know to get running locally and setup.
